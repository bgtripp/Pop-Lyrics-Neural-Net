        "# Hi!\n",
        "For this project, I decided to take neural nets a step further by using a generative recurring neural net to generate song lyrics. Using the same data from my first project, I trained my recurrent neural net on the lyrics for each year (stopped at 1999 for time) before uploading the weights to [this github repo](https://github.com/bgtripp/Lyrics-Neural-Net). The recurrent network has successive layers of nodes with weights that are impacted by the distance between layers allowing for machine learning based on sequences. Because song lyrics are just characters arranged in complex sequences of words, this type of network is perfect for the task. In this way, the network reads the input text as a sequence of characters, as opposed to an image recognition neural net that would read a whole bitmap array at once. This also solves the issue of all of the input text vectors being different sizes. In training, the networks attempt to predict the next character given the previous 30 characters. This means that for the first couple of epochs (rounds of training) the networks' attempts at generating lyrics are just jumbles of random characters, but it's fascinating to watch its progression below. The \"temperature\" values referenced below refer to the creativity of the network. The higher the value, the less likely the network is going to choose THE most predicted next character, and will come up with some more interesting, while sometimes nonsensical, results. Enjoy!"
